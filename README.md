# Pre Summer Python Review 2 Lab

## Objective: 
During this lab: 
- You will review the python material we went over.
- You will be more familiarized with python Dictionaries and Lists!


## Instructions:
> Before we start, make sure to create a new Repl.it and call it "Pre Summer Review"!

### Part 1: 
In `main.py` -
1. Define an empty dictionary and call it `fav_food`:
    - This dictionary will contain names as keys, and different food as values.
  
2. Creating a while loop:
    - Take an input from the user and display the message: ` "Enter any key to continue, and 'end' to stop: " ` and assign it to the variable x.
    - Create a while loop that runs while x is not equal to ` "end" `.
    - **Remember to take x again as an input inside the while loop in order not to have an endless loop**
    
3. Adding to the dictionary:
    In the `while` loop -
    - Take name as an input from the user, and assign it to the variable `name`.
    - Take favorite food as an input from the user, and assign it to the variable `fav_food`.
    - Add to the dictionary a new key and value, with `name` as the key and `fav_food` as the value.

**Good Job! Remember to show your wonderful work to your Instructor.**

### Part 2: 
1. Add this dictionary to your code.
2. Write a **function** that takes a `string` as a parameter and returns the same string but shifted by 3 letters - according to the Ceasar cipher. 
  - Use the encoder_caesar dictionary.
  - Example: `"meet"` - should be returned as `"phhw"`.
  - *Hint:* check how to print the value of a specific key in a python dictionary.


##### Great job!
